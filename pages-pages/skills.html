                <h1>Video Editing</h1>
                <p> Back in my high school days, I was basically a pocket-sized Spielberg, glued to my iOS device, 
                    where I first discovered the magic of video editing. I'd whip up these totally 'avant-garde' 
                    (read: hilariously cheesy) videos, layering on effects like they were sprinkles on a cinematic 
                    sundae. Plus, my dance covers? Forget choreography, it was all about the edits. Later, I leveled up, 
                    diving headfirst into the deep end of Davinci Resolve and Adobe Premiere Pro, where I learned to turn 
                    pixelated dreams into actual, watchable realities.

            <p>Same as video editing, but photo editing came in later when I was in my senior high school.
                Since I am fond of photography, photo editing has been my go to, to enhance my photos. I use 
                Adobe Lightroom CC on my phone and started using it also on my laptop.

                I am fond of designing and when I found out that I can create colorful
                websites, that is where I started to get attracted to Web Developing. As of
                now, I know how to use HTML and CSS. I am trying to widen my knowledge.

                <h1>Coding and Programming</h1>
                <p> Since I started my program in year 2021, I actually don't know what IT is and
                    what does it mean to be an IT student. All I know is it gives you wisdom about 
                    technologies and you will be able to know how to use it properly. The first Programming
                    language I learned is C but then I met Java that I don't like at all. But C# came and 
                    it gave me the fondness to learn programming. Thanks to sir Shaq Lintag for making C# interesting!
